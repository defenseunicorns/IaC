# If Renovate is the author of the PR that triggers this workflow, but the workflow event is anything but "opened", it will do nothing.
# If Renovate is the author of the PR that triggers this workflow, and the workflow event is "opened", it will:
#   1. Autoformat using pre-commit and, if necessary, push an additional commit to the PR with the autoformat fixes.
#   2. Add the "/test all" comment to the PR, so that the Slash Command Dispatch workflow is triggered automatically.
